Thanks for using my Auto-Glaive macro for Destiny 2!
See the GitHub if you want to see other macros for Destiny 2:
https://github.com/RomaBureacov/Destiny-Macros

This macro features:
	- ability to set your own custom settings:
		> melee key
		> reload key
		> config menu key
		> suspend macro key
		> delay between key presses

The way the macro works:
The glaives in Destiny 2 have an exploit: you can melee -> reload -> melee -> reload -> melee -> ... for a faster melee speed than the base melee speed of the glaive. Note that this requires the said glaive to be in a reloadable state.

This macro lets you finally buff the glaive melee speed and make glaives just a tiny bit better.

There are a few notes about this macro:

1 - You may set the Auto-Glaive key to your desire, but note that only the final key must be held to keep the Auto-Glaive active (e.g.: shift + c requires you to hit shift + c, but after that you only have to hold down c to keep the autoglaive active).

2 - The macro will only remain active while Destiny 2 is your active window.

3 - The macro will remain suspended while the config menu is active.

4 - This macro will spam your keyboard buttons and might cause problems when trying to type out messages in the text chat. Utilize your suspend key to temporarily suspend the macro, and hit it again to unsuspend the macro later.

5 - if you desire it, feel free to use this script as a general auto-melee script by omittin the reload parameter.

6 - To close the macro, either x-out of, or use Esc while in, the config menu. You may also simply close it through the tray icon by right-click and then exit.

Finally, if you plan to use the source code instead of the exe file, keep in mind that there is a hotkey set for the right control key to close the application. This is meant to be a development feature. The main exe file does not have this hotkey.

Have fun while this hasn't been patched out!
